# Hospital-JAVA-GUI

- For the MyConnection class, we did not use it because we have already defined a Connect () method class in each java file.
- The MyConnection class can be used to avoid the redundancy of the Connect () method.
- The use of JPanels instead of JButtons is a choice to improve the Design of the application.
- The hospital.sql file is the database file used in the app accompanied by all the tables created.
